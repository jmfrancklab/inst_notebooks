# inst_notebooks

This repository provides a package (Instruments) that represents USB and GPIB-connected instruments as file-like objects and allows the collection of data in [pyspecdata](http://jmfrancklab.github.io/pyspecdata) nddata format.

The documentation is not extensive, but feel free to contact us jmfranck [at] syr.edu.  A manuscript describing the implementation of this package in the context of Overhauser DNP (enhanced Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) is forthcoming.

Currently supported instruments include:

* Instek oscilloscope
* Instek frequency generator
* HP Microwave Frequency source
* Gigatronics power meter
